## Matlab Utilities

These are a set of matlab scripts that I have made for small tasks

- slope_field: Calculates the slope field given a function of the form $\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x)$, $\frac{dy}{dx} = f(y)$, $\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x, y). Tries to scale manually. I'd recommend using `dfield` since this struggles to scale vectors correctly.$

- proj_gs_qr: Gram-Schmidt decomposition similar to one done by hand, not unlike QR decomposition.
